Create a directory (mkdir terraform) then copy the files to create infrastructure in aws then 2 keypair are
generated and then copy 1st key and save with .pem extension and do ssh using mobaxterm username (ubuntu)
then do the following:

perform all the commands with root access (sudo su -) or use sudo with every command

1. copy the 2nd ssh key on master machine and save with .pem extension and change permission to 600 of 2nd key
   (chmod 600 key.pem) 

2. perform the following commands in both master and slave machines:

apt-get update -y; apt-get upgrade -y 
apt-get install apt-transport-https software-properties-common ca-certificates -y
wget https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg
apt-key add gpg
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial stable" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
apt-get update -y
apt-get install docker-ce -y
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker

3. configure firewall ports on master machine by the following commands:

ufw allow 22/tcp
ufw allow 2376/tcp
ufw allow 2377/tcp
ufw allow 7946/tcp
ufw allow 7946/udp
ufw allow 4789/udp

ufw enable
ufw reload

systemctl restart docker

4. perform following command on master machine:

docker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.1.0.25

systemctl restart docker

5. copy the output (docker swarm join) from master machine and then do the following in slave machine:

systemctl restart docker

(docker swarm join) command

systemctl restart docker

6. finally move to master machine and check using (docker node ls) it will show 2 outputs.
